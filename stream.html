        <h2>Our Stream</h2>
        <p>The stream is named Chorreffic Entertainment. It is a combination of chores and terrific then the word entertainment because we want to not just teach the audience but also to entertain them with the designs and how we stream during the stream. In our stream we make a simple tutorial about chores teaching on how important chores are to our daily lives and how significant chores are to our cores and values with a twist that will entertain them. The reason why we choose this content is because after we emphasize, we noticed in modern times, teens are now most likely to have their attention on the things that they want rather than the things that they need to have or do. Like was mentioned, basic chores are critical when it comes to life growth experience. Without having to practice or experience these types of assignments, it can affect oneâ€™s responsibility in the future. That is why, here in our stream we provide samples that can be easily learned by the audiences, starting from the basics to the essentials such as sweeping, dusting and dishwashing. With our main goal being projected as our vision, we seek to create a foundation where life, time and happiness can be balanced while at the same time focusing on what is needed the most.<br><br>
